<u> Project: Full Kitchen Remodel </u>
<br>
“We had a vision for a modern farmhouse kitchen, but we weren’t sure how to bring it to life—until we met Tekton Construction. From the first meeting, they were professional, transparent, and full of great ideas. They helped us pick sustainable materials and even reworked our kitchen layout to add more space and light. The result? A stunning, functional kitchen that we love spending time in. They finished on time and within our budget. We’d recommend Tekton to anyone.” - Melissa Johnson

<u>Project: Custom New Home </u>
<br>
“After years of saving, we were ready to build our forever home. Tekton Construction treated our project like it was their own—meticulous planning, constant updates, and amazing craftsmanship. They helped us incorporate energy-efficient features, like solar panels and triple-pane windows, without pushing us over budget. The attention to detail in everything from the hardwood floors to the crown molding is outstanding. We get compliments every time someone visits!” - Carlos Ortega

<u> Project: Back Deck</u>
<br>
We hired Tekton Construction to design and build a new back deck, and we couldn’t be happier with the results. From the start, their team was professional, responsive, and full of great design ideas. They helped us choose durable materials that matched our home’s exterior and offered suggestions that made the space feel more open—like adding built-in benches and subtle lighting. The crew worked quickly but carefully, cleaned up every day, and finished ahead of schedule. Now our deck is the highlight of our home—we use it for everything from quiet morning coffee to weekend barbecues. Highly recommend Tekton to anyone looking to upgrade their outdoor space!
